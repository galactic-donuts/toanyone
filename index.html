        <div id="group-description">2NE1 (Korean: 투애니원, IPA: [tʰu.ɛ.ni.wʌn]) was a South Korean girl group that was composed of Bom, CL, Dara, and Minzy.
        The group was formed by YG Entertainment in 2009. After appearing alongside boy band Big Bang on the promotional single
        "Lollipop", the group rose to fame with the release of their eponymous extended plays 2NE1 (2009) and 2NE1 (2011), and
        studio albums, To Anyone (2010) and Crush (2014); all of which peaked at number one on the Gaon Album Chart. The group
        also had nine number-one hits on the Gaon Digital Chart, which include "Go Away", "I Am the Best", "I Love You", and
        "Come Back Home".

        The lead singles off of their first EP, "Fire" and "I Don't Care”, instantly brought the group to national attention,
        both achieving success in South Korea and other parts of Asia. "I Don't Care" received the Song of the Year award at the
        2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards, making them the first music group to win a daesang in the same year of debut. They
        continued their success with their first studio-album To Anyone and 2011 sophomore EP, the latter of which produced the
        four chart-topping singles "Don't Cry", "Lonely", "I Am the Best" and "Ugly". Following their 2012 single "I Love You",
        the group embarked on their New Evolution Global Tour, which made stops in 11 cities in seven countries in Asia and
        North America, and set a milestone in the industry for being the first world tour for a K-pop girl group. Their final
        studio album Crush in 2014 became the highest charting K-pop album on the Billboard 200 at the time, peaking at number
        sixty-one.

        The quartet also conducted a parallel career in Japan, first releasing a Japanese version of their second EP Nolza
        (2011) and following up with the studio albums Collection (2012) and the Japanese version of Crush (2014). Following a
        long hiatus, Minzy left the group in April 2016, while the remaining members disbanded that November. Their final
        single "Goodbye" was released on January 21, 2017.

        Known for their unique fashion, stage presence and charisma, 2NE1 was considered one of the most successful and popular
        South Korean girl groups during the span of their career. They have reportedly sold 66.5 million records, which
        would make them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Billboard magazine ranked 2NE1 as one of the best
        K-pop girl groups of the past decade while The New York Times named 2NE1's New Evolution Global Tour stop at the
        Prudential Center in New Jersey as one of the "Best Concerts of 2012".</div>
